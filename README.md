# little-logger

Sometimes you need a robust logging mechanism for your enterprise-level system. For those times, little-logger is not for you.

Little-logger is a little logging utility for node.js. Its more for those times when you need to sprinkle a little logging in your code.

Though it may be little, it still packs some nice features, like:

  * Four different logging levels: debug, info, warn, error
  * Colorized output
  * Custom formatters for controlling the output
  * Log to stdio, stderr, or specify your own logging function.
  * Small code base: less than 100 loc, no external dependencies.

Take a look at [example.js](https://github.com/monsur/little-logger/blob/master/example.js) for usage info.
